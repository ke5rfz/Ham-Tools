# Ham-Tools
A collection of ideas, tools, code and hardware sources for Amatuer Radio related activity
This is certainly a work in progress, and I hope to encourage creative HAMS and programmers to contribute.  
The goal is to encourage new HAMS by providing tools and contacts.  
The Raspberry Pi is a super small computer that is readily available online and from many local computer and electronic stores.
This collection will also house ideas and tools for the Pi, especially as related to their use in the Amatuer Radio world.
